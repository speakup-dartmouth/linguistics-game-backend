## What Worked Well
implementing basic functionality was fairly intuitive, easy to set up get, post, put, etc.

## What Didn't
had to refactor Lab 4 slightly to account for changes

## Extra Credit
Added findPosts() method; can append an optional query to /posts GET request (e.g. /posts?q=test) in order to search
